  <Accordion title="Security">
    In general, Open Source softwares are more secure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complete Transparency">
    We believe that the ultimate freedom is when you have nothing to hide. So putting everything out there lets you focus on the actual problems you are solving and not competitors.

  <Accordion title="Trust">
    Building Trust of Customers is crucial, and relatively easier with a Startup rather than a Large Cooperation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Going all in">
    We are taking on a big challenge and we want to grow at great velocity and innovate faster along with the community.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Having a Global Team">
  Building with the community and in public is more joyful:  We think it's a very fun process. It just becomes more enjoyable because multiple amazingly smart people can contribute from around the world; shit is breaking sometimes, but it’s like having a big global team from Day 1, What’s not to like?
